## Content Management with PagesCMS

This blog is configured to work with [PagesCMS](https://pagescms.org), a Git-based CMS that lets you edit content through a web interface.

### Getting Started with PagesCMS

1. Push this repository to GitHub
2. Visit [pagescms.org](https://pagescms.org)
3. Connect your GitHub repository
4. Start editing your blog posts and content through the PagesCMS interface

### Content Structure

- **Blog Posts**: Located in `content/posts/` as Markdown files
- **About Page**: Located at `content/about.md`
- **Media**: Images and assets go in `public/images/`

### Adding New Blog Posts

You can add new blog posts in two ways:

1. **Through PagesCMS** (recommended): Use the web interface to create and edit posts
2. **Manually**: Create a new `.md` file in `content/posts/` with the following frontmatter:

\`\`\`markdown
---
title: Your Post Title
excerpt: A brief description of your post
date: 2025-01-15
readTime: 5 min read
slug: your-post-slug
---

\`\`\`

All changes made through PagesCMS will be committed back to your GitHub repository automatically.
