# Typography in Web Design

Typography is the backbone of web design. It's estimated that 95% of web content is text, making typography one of the most important design decisions you'll make.

## The Fundamentals

**Hierarchy**: Create clear visual levels through size, weight, and spacing. Your h1 should command attention, while body text should be comfortable to read for extended periods.

**Line Height**: Proper line spacing (leading) dramatically improves readability. Aim for 1.4-1.6 times your font size for body text.

**Line Length**: The optimal line length is 50-75 characters. Too long, and readers lose their place. Too short, and the eye tires from constant line breaks.

## Choosing Fonts

Select fonts that match your content's tone and purpose. A financial services site needs different typography than a creative portfolio. Consider pairing a distinctive display font for headings with a highly readable font for body text.

## Responsive Typography

Typography must adapt to different screen sizes. Use relative units like rem and em, and adjust sizes at breakpoints to maintain readability across devices.

## Performance Matters

Web fonts impact load time. Choose variable fonts when possible, subset fonts to include only needed characters, and always provide fallback fonts for better performance.
