Every element should serve a purpose, every pixel should earn its place.\n\n## The Power of White Space\n\nWhite space, or negative space, is one of the most powerful tools in a designer's arsenal. It gives content room to breathe and helps guide the user's eye to what matters most.\n\n## Typography as a Foundation\n\nWhen you strip away decorative elements, typography becomes your primary design tool. Choose fonts carefully and use hierarchy to create visual interest.\n\n## Color with Purpose\n\nA limited color palette forces you to be intentional. Each color should have meaning and contribute to the overall user experience."

Users shouldn't have to think about how to use your product—it should feel natural and intuitive from the first interaction.\n\n## Understanding Your Users\n\nBefore designing anything, understand who you're designing for. User research isn't optional—it's the foundation of good UX.\n\n## Consistency is Key\n\nConsistent patterns help users build mental models. When similar actions produce similar results, users feel confident and in control.\n\n## Accessibility First\n\nAccessible design isn't a feature—it's a requirement. Design for everyone from the start, not as an afterthought."

It sets the tone, establishes hierarchy, and can make or break the reading experience.\n\n## Choosing the Right Typeface\n\nYour typeface choice communicates personality. Serif fonts feel traditional and trustworthy, while sans-serifs feel modern and clean.\n\n## Hierarchy and Scale\n\nUse size, weight, and spacing to create clear visual hierarchy. Readers should instantly understand what's most important.\n\n## Line Length and Spacing\n\nOptimal line length is 50-75 characters. Too long and readers lose their place; too short and reading becomes choppy."
